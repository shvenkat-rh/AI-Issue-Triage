CLI argument parsing fails with special characters
When running ansible-creator with arguments containing special characters like quotes or backslashes, the argument parser throws an error. This happens specifically when using:

ansible-creator init --name "my-collection" --path "/path/with spaces/"

Expected: Should handle special characters gracefully
Actual: Crashes with ArgumentError

Error message: ArgumentError: argument --name: invalid value
Environment: Python 3.9, Linux

Steps to reproduce:
1. Run: ansible-creator init --name "test-collection" --path "/tmp/my path/"
2. Observe the error
3. Try with backslashes in Windows paths

This affects user experience significantly as many users have spaces in their project paths.
